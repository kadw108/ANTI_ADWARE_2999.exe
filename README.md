## [Play in Browser Here](https://kanderwund.itch.io/adware2999)

The final game and its assets are in the `dist` folder, but you'll need to start a local server to play it, if you don't want to play the browser version.

Contains source code for ANTI_ADWARE_2999.exe, a very small shooter made in a few days for [Bullet Hell Jam V](https://itch.io/jam/bullet-hell-v).

The game was made with [Phaser](https://github.com/phaserjs) and Typescript, and is my first Phaser game. Code is based on the template from [https://www.emanueleferonato.com/2024/01/12/getting-ready-to-develop-html5-games-with-phaser-and-typescript-a-free-minibook-to-get-you-started/](https://www.emanueleferonato.com/2024/01/12/getting-ready-to-develop-html5-games-with-phaser-and-typescript-a-free-minibook-to-get-you-started/).

`npm run development` runs the development version.

`npm run distribution` runs the distriution/final version.
